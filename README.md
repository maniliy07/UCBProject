#Capstone Project.

**Problem Statement: Resume Evaluator for Requirements and Provide Score Using OpenAI and Generative AI**
**Background**
As the job market becomes increasingly competitive, candidates often face challenges in tailoring their resumes to meet specific job requirements. Recruiters, inundated with applications, struggle to efficiently evaluate resumes and identify the best candidates. Leveraging OpenAI's capabilities and Generative AI, this project aims to develop a sophisticated resume evaluation tool that automatically assesses resumes against job descriptions, scores them based on relevance, and provides actionable feedback for improvement.
**Objective**
The primary goal of this project is to create an AI-powered resume evaluator that: 
1.	**Analyzes Resumes**: Utilizes OpenAI’s natural language processing capabilities to extract and analyze key information from resumes, such as skills, work experience, education, and relevant keywords.
2.	**Evaluates Job Descriptions**: Processes job descriptions to identify essential requirements and qualifications using advanced NLP techniques.
3.	**Scores Resumes**: Implements a scoring algorithm that evaluates how well a resume matches the job description, taking into account various factors such as keyword relevance, experience alignment, and overall presentation.
4.	**Generates Feedback**: Uses Generative AI to provide personalized, constructive feedback to candidates on how to enhance their resumes to better align with specific job requirements.
Key Features
1.	**NLP-Powered Resume Parsing**:
o	Extracts relevant sections of resumes using OpenAI’s language models to ensure accurate information retrieval.
2.	**Extraction Job Requirement:**
o	Analyzes job descriptions to identify and categorize essential skills, qualifications, and experience needed for the role.
3.	**Scoring Algorithm:**
o	Develops a scoring system that quantifies the alignment between resumes and job descriptions using metrics such as keyword match percentage, relevance of experience, and completeness.
4.	**Generative Feedback Mechanism:**
o	Provides personalized feedback generated by AI, offering suggestions on how to improve the resume based on identified gaps and best practices.
5.	**User-Friendly Interface:**
o	Implements a web application using frameworks like Flask or Streamlit, allowing users to easily upload resumes and job descriptions, view scoring results, and access feedback.
Methodology
1.**	**Data Collection**:
o	Gather a diverse dataset of resumes and job descriptions from various sources, ensuring a broad representation of industries and roles.
o	Optionally, label some resumes with expert evaluations to train the scoring model.
2.**	**Data Preprocessing**:**
o	Clean and preprocess the text data using NLP techniques, including tokenization, normalization, and entity recognition.
3.	**Model Development:**
o	Leverage OpenAI’s APIs to build the resume analysis and feedback generation functionalities.
o	Experiment with various scoring algorithms, considering both traditional machine learning methods and advanced AI techniques.
4.	**Model Evaluation:**
o	Test the model's effectiveness using a separate validation dataset and evaluate it based on accuracy, precision, recall, and user satisfaction with feedback.
5.	**User Interface Development**:
o	Create an intuitive web application that allows users to interact with the resume evaluator seamlessly, displaying scores and feedback in an easily digestible format.
6.**Expected Outcomes**
•	A robust AI-driven resume evaluation tool that accurately scores resumes against job descriptions.
•	Insights into common gaps in candidate resumes and personalized recommendations for improvement.
•	An enhanced user experience for both job seekers and recruiters, streamlining the hiring process.
7.**Conclusion**
By utilizing OpenAI and Generative AI techniques, this capstone project aims to revolutionize the way resumes are evaluated and improve the job application process for candidates. The combination of automated scoring and personalized feedback will empower job seekers to present their qualifications more effectively and increase their chances of securing interviews.
